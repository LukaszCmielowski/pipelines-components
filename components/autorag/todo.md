Changes that still need to be introduced in order to fully support the new components structure:  

📋 update anything in `scripts/` that does not accept the `components/autorag` package, 
📋 `pyproject.toml` make sure is aware of the top-level `autorag` component package, 
📋 add any needed metadata-files for a component in the `components/autorag` directory,
